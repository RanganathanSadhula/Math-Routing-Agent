# Math-Routing-Agent
This document provides a final proposal and implementation code skeleton for the 'Math Routing Agent' assignment. The system is an Agentic-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture designed to act like a mathematics professor: when given a math question it first checks a knowledge base, retrieves step-by-step solutions.
